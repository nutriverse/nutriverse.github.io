**Date:** Friday, 27 February 2026    
**Time:** multiple time slots    
**Venue:** Online via Zoom    

:::

We will be launching the **nutriverse**, an *open-source project*, a *collective*, and a *community-of-practice*.

We will present on how **nutriverse** came to be, *who the core team members* are, *what tools and products* we have created and made available to the nutrition community-at-large, and our plans for *more tools development* and in *growing this community of practice*.

The nutriverse Project Launch will be online in a webinar format and held at three different one hour periods on the 27th of February 2026 to cater for a global audience participating at different time zones.

* 08:00 - 09:00 GMT - this time period will hopefully cater for those from Asia Pacific

* 14:00 - 15:00 GMT - this time period will hopefully cater for those from UK, Europe, and Africa

* 20:00 - 21:00 GMT - this time period will hopefully cater for those from North and South America

We are requiring registration as we can only accommodate a fixed number of participants in each of the three sessions above. You may register for a session time that is convenient for you (and not necessarily from where you are located) but we would like to ask that you book only one time session to allow as many people the chance to participate.

Registration is open now at [https://forms.gle/eLH2xxprZ2PoaEFg9](https://forms.gle/eLH2xxprZ2PoaEFg9){.external target="_blank"}.

The session Zoom link will be provided via email after your registration. Please note that this process of receiving your registration and emailing with project launch session details is human-powered (not automated). We aim to get back to you within 24 hours of receiving your registration.

We look forward to seeing you at our launch!
