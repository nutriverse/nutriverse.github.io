[SMART](https://www.smartmethodology.org){.external target="blank"} is an inter-agency initiative launched in 2002 by a network of organizations and humanitarian practitioners. [SMART](https://www.smartmethodology.org){.external target="blank"} advocates a multi-partner, systematized approach to provide critical, reliable information for decision-making, and to establish shared systems and resources for host government partners and humanitarian organizations. The [SMART Methodology](https://www.smartmethodology.org){.external target="blank"} is an improved survey method that balances simplicity (for rapid assessment of acute emergencies) and technical soundness. This package provides functions to perform the various analysis used in [SMART](https://www.smartmethodology.org){.external target="blank"}.
