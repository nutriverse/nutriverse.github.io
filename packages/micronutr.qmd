Vitamin and mineral deficiencies continue to be a significant public health problem. This is particularly critical in developing countries where deficiencies to vitamin A, iron, iodine, and other micronutrients lead to adverse health consequences. Cross-sectional surveys are helpful in answering questions related to the magnitude and distribution of deficiencies of selected vitamins and minerals.

This package provides tools for determining select vitamin and mineral deficiencies based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines found [here](https://www.who.int/teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/databases/vitamin-and-mineral-nutrition-information-system).

## What does `micronutr` do?

The `{micronutr}` package provides tools for determining select vitamin and mineral deficiencies using R. Currently, `{micronutr}` has functions for:

* Detecting **haemoglobinaemia** or anaemia based on an individual's *serum haemoglobin* level;

* Detecting **inflammation** status based on *c-reactive protein (CRP)* and *alpha(1)-acid-glycoprotein (AGP)*;

* Detecting **iron deficiency** status based on an individual's *serum ferritin* level;

* Detecting **iodine deficiency** status based on a population's mean urinary iodine concentration.

For more information on the `{micronutr}` package, you can visit the [project website](https://nutriverse.io/micronutr/). To learn about the underlying code for this software development project, see the [GitHub code repository](https://github.com/nutriverse/micronutr).
