## What does `{zscorer}` do?

The `{zscorer}` packages facilitates the calculation of a range of anthropometric *z-scores* (i.e. the number of standard deviations from the mean) and adds them to survey data:

* **Weight-for-length (wfl)** z-scores for children with lengths between 45 and 110 cm

* **Weight-for-height (wfh)** z-scores for children with heights between 65 and 120 cm

* **Length-for-age (lfa)** z-scores for children aged less than 24 months

* **Height-for-age (hfa)** z-scores for children aged between 24 and 228 months

* **Weight-for-age (wfa)** z-scores for children aged between zero and 120 months

* **Body mass index-for-age (bfa)** z-scores for children aged between zero and 228 months

* **MUAC-for-age (mfa)** z-scores for children aged between 3 and 228 months

* **Triceps skinfold-for-age (tsa)** z-scores for children aged between 3 and 60 months

* **Sub-scapular skinfold-for-age (ssa)** z-scores for children aged between 3 and 60 months

* **Head circumference-for-age (hca)** z-scores for children aged between zero and 60 months
