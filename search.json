This experience includes several research positions, joint authorship of research papers and all aspects of the Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programming including; design, set up, training implementation mentoring and evaluation in both emergency and developmental contexts. I have the experience within the CMAM framework on; early identification and treatment of acute malnutrition, maternal infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN), nutrition assessments using the Simplified LQAS Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SLEAC), Semi-Quantitative Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SQUEAC), Simple Sampling Survey Method (S3M) survey methodologies. Managed to apply these methodologies in assessing the coverage of different micronutrient supplementation interventions including Vitamin A, Supplementation (VAS), deworming, Iron Folic Acid (IFA), and Micronutrient Powder (MNPs) in Liberia and Ethiopia. This has also included assessing the coverage of Growth Monitoring and Vaccination among under-five children.\nExperienced in conducting baseline, mid-line and end-line/final evaluations for different United Nations agencies such as UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP, International NGOs, and Ministries of Health in Malawi, Sub Saharan and Asia regions.\nI am also an expert in qualitative study approaches such as the Focused Ethnographic Studies (FES). I have contributed to the design, implementation and evaluation of the community mobilization/outreach component of Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programmes using interactive and participatory approaches to social research in both emergency and development interventions. This involves conducting rapid socio-cultural context assessments and analysis of local socio-political structures, health attitudes and health seeking behaviors, and barriers to access to develop context-specific and culturally appropriate community mobilization/Social Behavior Change and Communication (SBCC) strategies."

    "section": "What are the IYCF Indicators?",
    "text": "What are the IYCF Indicators?\nThe first 1,000 days of life (from pregnancy to a child’s 2nd birthday) are critical for addressing childhood malnutrition, especially stunting. Infant and young child feeding practices (IYCF) largely overlap with this period as they cover breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices for the first two years of a child’s life. They also have a significant impact on childhood health, nutrition outcomes, and child survival. It is, therefore, critical for countries to measure IYCF practices as part of their efforts to monitor their progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 2. It is also important for development agencies to be able to monitor and evaluate their programs aimed at improving infant and young child feeding practices towards improved overall childhood nutrition.\nWHO and UNICEF released the first IYCF indicators definition and measurement guidelines in 2008. In 2021, these guidelines were updated along with a revised standard questionnaire to capture the information required to calculate the updated IYCF indicators since the first initial publication. In general, the IYCF indicators can be categorized into three main categories: (1) breastfeeding indicators, (2) complementary indicators, and (3) other indicators, which are focused on bottle-feeding practices and the generation of data visualization plots for the breastfeeding status by age.",

    "text": "Why riycf package?\nAlthough the initial measurement guidelines were published in 2008 with many humanitarian organizations and country health ministries implementing these indicators, no comprehensive statistical programming package to calculate these indicators is yet available. Therefore, every time the researchers (or humanitarian organizations) are required to collect and analyze, they need a considerable amount of time to re-code all the syntax (depending on which statistical program they are using). That is time-consuming work.\nThis riycf package aims to address that technical gap by providing an easy-to-use package of automated functions` to calculate all IYCF indicators provided in the WHO guideline (the Indicators for assessing infant and young child feeding practices: definitions and measurement methods). This include comprehensive guidelines for step-by-step usage of each automated function to analyze individual IYCF indicators in R software to make it easier for those less familiar with R software.\nFor more information on the {riycf} package, you can visit the project website.

    "text": "Child anthropometric assessments are the cornerstones of child nutrition and food security surveillance around the world. Ensuring the quality of data from these assessments is paramount to obtaining accurate child under nutrition prevalence estimates. The timeliness of reporting is, as well, critical to allowing timely situation analyses and responses to tackle the needs of the affected population.\nThe {mwana} package streamlines data quality checks of and acute undernutrition prevalence estimation from anthropometric data of children aged 6 to 59 months old. This is made possible through the many years of leadership and development work in nutrition surveys of the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) initiative through its nutrition survey guidance which {mwana} builds upon as a development framework. The main functionalities of the {mwana} package on acute undernutrition data quality checks are mainly convenience wrappers to functions in the {nipnTK} package.\nThe term mwana means child in Elómwè, a local language spoken in the central-northern regions of Mozambique where the author hails from.

    "text": "Motivation\n{mwana} was borne out of the author’s own experience of having to work with multiple child anthropometric data sets to conduct data quality appraisal and prevalence estimation as part of the Quality Assurance Team of the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Global Support Unit. The current standard child anthropometric data appraisal workflow is extremely cumbersome, requiring significant time and effort utilizing different software tools - SPSS, Microsoft Excel, SMART Emergency Nutrition Assessment (ENA) software - for each step of the process for a single dataset. This process is repeated for every data set needing to be processed and often needing to be implemented in a relatively short period of time. This manual and repetitive process, by its nature, is extremely error-prone.\n{mwana} provides functions that can simplify this cumbersome workflow into a process that can be programmatically designed particularly when handling multiple-area datasets. Whilst developed with the analytic and reporting needs of the IPC Global Support Unit in mind, {mwana} can be used generally for anthropometric datasets of children for the purpose of assessing data quality and for estimating prevalence of acute undernutrition in children 6-59 months old.\nFor more information on the {mwana} package, you can visit the project website.
