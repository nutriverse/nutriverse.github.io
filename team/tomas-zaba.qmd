I am a public health nutritionist with over nine years of experience in public health nutrition evidence generation through population-based surveys, research, situation analysis, and programming, both in development and emergency contexts. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Nutrition from Universidade Lúrio in Nampula, Mozambique, and a Master of Public Health with a specialization in International Public Health from the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. I am pursuing an MBA in Data Science and Analytics at the Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil.

With a passion for data science, I am particularly interested in modeling - both spatial and non-spatial analytics - and software development. My goal is to harness the power of data science, combined with my domain technical expertise, to address common, complex public health and nutrition challenges and contribute to enhanced evidence-based decision-making, with a special focus on complex emergency contexts.
