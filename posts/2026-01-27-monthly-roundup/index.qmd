It's again the start of a new year and we are starting 2026 in the same way as previous years with general update and maintenance cycle for all nutriverse packages. We have started with our three packages that are already published on the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org) - [`{zscorer}`](https://nutriverse.io/zscorer), [`{nipnTK}`](https://nutriverse.io/nipnTK), and [`{micronutr}`](https://nutriverse.io/micronutr) - which have undergone routine yearly upkeep. This year, we are rolling out our new branding scheme for our package website! All three packages have been spruced up and we will have them submitted for a yearly update version by the second week of February at the latest.

We have also been working on our Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) coverage assessment set of packages - [`{squeacr}`](https://nutriverse.io/squeacr) and [`{sleacr}`](https://nutriverse.io/sleacr). We have been developing these packages for more than 3 years now and we are happy to report that [`{sleacr}`](https://nutriverse.io/sleacr) is ready for submission to CRAN. We will let you know once it has been accepted. [`{squeacr}`](https://nutriverse.io/sqeuacr) on the other hand is on its final steps of development leading to a first release. We are aiming for it to be ready for submission latest by the end of February 2026.

These are all the updates for now!
