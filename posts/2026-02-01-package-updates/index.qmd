We've just released a patched version of [`{nipnTK}`](https://nutriverse.io/nipnTK) (v0.2.2), our nutrition data quality toolkit R package, on [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nipnTK/index.html). This was a general upkeep and maintenance update focused on tidying up documentation including the package [website](https://nutriverse.io/nipnTK) which now sports the new nutriverse colour and branding scheme. Existing users of the [`{nipnTK}`](https://nutriverse.io/nipnTK) package will be able to continue using the package as before after updating. If you work with nutrition data specifically anthropometric measurements data, consider looking into [`{nipnTK}`](https://nutriverse.io/nipnTK) and give it a try in your nutrition data processing workflows.

We've also spruced up the development versions of the [`{micronutr}`](https://nutriverse.io/micronutr) and the [`{anthrocheckr}`](https://nutriverse.io/anthrocheckr) packages. Again, these updates are all general upkeep and maintenance focusing on package documentation and website. We plan to get a minor version release on CRAN for [`{micronutr}`](https://nutriverse.io/micronutr) by end of March 2026 that will include new functions for adjusting serum micronutrient biomarkers for inflammation using the [Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) Method](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36792034/). For `{anthrocheckr}`, we plan to get a first CRAN release by the end of February 2026.
